Hi, Loadsman here.

## Install

* [Chrome app store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loadsman/cioeodjdpjdfcgbakmhbmnnnnkoaflfk)

## Demo

No demo for Loadsman as yet, but I got one for [Laravel api tester](http://laravel-api-tester.asva.by/api-tester), a similar app. Api tester got more power but is limited to Laravel only.

## Intention
Loadsman is a chrome extension with plugin ecosystem that allows manual tinkering of routes.
Think of [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) with framework integration.

## Plugins

### PHP
* [Laravel](https://github.com/loadsman/laravel-plugin)
* [Symfony](https://github.com/loadsman/symfony-plugin)

### Node.js
* [Express](https://github.com/loadsman/symfony-plugin)

## Security
Every piece of data is stored in your browser (local storage, indexed db, extension storage). Nothing is sent online or kept in your project's storages.

## Feedback and state of things
At this point of time, Loadsman is clean bones. Feel free to spam [issues](https://github.com/loadsman/loadsman/issues) or discuss you ideas in [chat][gitter-url].
