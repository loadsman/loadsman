Hi, Loadsman here.

## Install

* [Chrome app store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cioeodjdpjdfcgbakmhbmnnnnkoaflfk/publish-delayed)

## Intention
Loadsman is a chrome extension with plugin ecosystem that allows manual tinkering of routes.
Think of [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) with framework integration.

## Plugins

* [Laravel](https://github.com/loadsman/laravel-plugin)
* [Symfony](https://github.com/loadsman/symfony-plugin)

### Node.js
* [Express](https://github.com/loadsman/symfony-plugin)

## Security
Every piece of data is stored in your browser (local storage, indexed db, extension storage). Nothing is sent online or kept in your project's storages.
